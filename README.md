# Ciao Cow

This application is just a playground to test out [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters).
The static resources, i.e. the logo and lines, are static files in the app. 

The site shows a random farwell in a card that is styled to look like
a law paragraph. The logo was generated using Dalle.

Cheers, Linda
